## What i learn?

In the Greeden Plant Shop project, i will learn and practice a variety of skills in web development, with a focus on using Tailwind CSS. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and skills you can gain:

### 1. HTML Structure and Layout
* Creating Sections: Learn how to divide a webpage into logical sections like Header, Products, Contact Us, and Footer.
* Semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML tags like <section>, <header>, <footer>, and <article> to improve accessibility and readability.
* Forms: Design a simple contact form or integrate a call-to-action button.

### 2. Responsive Web Design with Tailwind CSS
* Tailwind CSS Basics: Understand how to use Tailwind's utility classes for styling, such as bg-gray-100, text-xl, p-6, and more.
* Mobile-First Design: Use Tailwind’s responsive design system to ensure that your website looks good on both mobile and desktop devices. Apply different styles at different screen widths, e.g., md:grid-cols-2 for medium screens.
* Grid Layout: Master the grid system in Tailwind to create flexible, responsive layouts for products, images, etc.

### 3. Styling with Tailwind CSS
* Utility-First Approach: Tailwind CSS uses a utility-first approach, meaning you apply multiple small utility classes to elements to style them instead of writing custom CSS.
* Customizing Styles: Customize elements like buttons, images, and containers with Tailwind’s classes.
* Hover and Focus States: Apply hover effects to buttons and interactive elements (like links) with classes like hover:bg-green-500.

### 4. Project Structure and File Organization
* Organizing Files: Learn how to structure your project files clearly, including separating assets like images, styles, and documentation.
* Modular Code: Structure your code so it's easy to scale and maintain. Keep HTML, CSS, and assets in separate folders (e.g., assets/images and assets/styles).
